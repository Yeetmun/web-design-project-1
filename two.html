                Being able to see your stuff is all fine and dandy, but what if you have some <em><u><strong>extra important</strong></u></em> things that <em>NEEDS</em> to be seen?
                Or maybe you need to something <a href="#">clickable</a> in your content such as a link to another resource or part of the site? That's alright let's just use different colors!
                How about we make our <span style="color: blue">important things</span> a <span style="color: green">nice looking</span><span style="color:red"> red?</span> This way, <span style="color:purple">people using the site, or users</span>
                will be able to <span style="color: goldenrod">quickly and easily</span> see that it's something <span style="color: hotpink">super important</span> and <span style="color: aquamarine; background-color:black">click</span> on it!
                We can <span style="color: greenyellow; background-color: black">test</span> it out right <a style="text-decoration: none; color: red" href="#">here</a> in this very <span style="color:mediumorchid">sentence!</span> Wait... where is the link?
                <br><br>
                Although the text already points you to where the link should be, it wasn't exactly easy to tell which word the link was, was it? Even though our original idea of using a standout color was theoretically a good one, the fact that many other words also had 
                standout color meant that our color lost it's meaning. This can happen with any one method of giving emphasis to items such as bold or italics. Of course, whether or not a chosen method stands out is highly dependent on the content surrounding it, but with only
                one method, such as underlining, a user may not realize it's a link but instead just some word that you wanted to be emphasized, and not even attempt to click it.
                <br><br>
                The solution to this problem is to combine multiple methods while also making it quite clear that you're going to be providing something to click on, through explicit or implicit means. The standard &lt;a&gt; tag is actually quite a good example of this. When
                used without modifications it creates a piece of text that has a very identifiable blue color and an underline. Since text online will rarely ever be both blue and underlined, it will be much harder for users to misunderstand your content. Additionally, Even if your other content
                has different colors or is underlined, the combination of the two will ensure that your link still stands out in some way. <span style="font-size: 6px">Unless you write entirely in underlined blue, for some reason.</span>
                <br><br>
                This general idea also applies to things like icons or buttons that want to capture the users attention and becomes especially important if your website features a lot of noise such as images or colors. However that's getting more
                into UX design and theory and whatnot and is outside the scope of this "presentation". Capisce?
